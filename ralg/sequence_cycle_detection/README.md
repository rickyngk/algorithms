#Cycle detection

In computer science, cycle detection is the algorithmic problem of finding a cycle in a sequence of iterated function values.

For any function ƒ that maps a finite set S to itself, and any initial value x0 in S, the sequence of iterated function values: x0, x1=f(x0), x2=f(x1), ... , xi=f(x_{i-1}), ... must eventually use the same value twice: there must be some i ≠ j such that xi = xj. Once this happens, the sequence must continue periodically, by repeating the same sequence of values from xi to xj−1. Cycle detection is the problem of finding i and j, given ƒ and x0.
